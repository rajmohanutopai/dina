# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Important:** Always consult `README.md` for the full product vision, design philosophy, and long-term direction. Every technical decision should align with the principles described there.

## Project Overview

**Dina** — The Architecture of Agency. Inspired by the novel *[UTOPAI](https://github.com/rajmohanutopai/utopai/blob/main/UTOPAI_2017_full.pdf)* (2012–2017).

Dina is a **sovereign personal AI** and the **safety layer for autonomous agents**. She is a digital extension of *your* will, interests, and values. She serves one master: the human who created her. Not advertisers, not platforms, not corporations. This singular loyalty naturally produces a "Pull Economy" where the agent fetches verified truth on demand instead of being fed ads.

Dina also solves a critical safety gap: autonomous agents today operate without oversight — leaking credentials, accepting commands from anyone, acting without guardrails. Any agent supporting the Dina protocol submits its **intent** to Dina before acting. Dina checks: does this violate your privacy rules? Is this vendor trusted? Are you in the right state to make this decision? Safe tasks pass through silently. Risky actions (sending email, moving money, sharing data) are flagged for your review. The agent never holds your keys, never sees your full history, and never acts without oversight. Regardless of which autonomous agent does the work, the safety layer stays the same.

### The Four Laws

Every design decision must honour these:

1. **Silence First** — Never push content. Only speak when the human asked, or when silence would cause harm. Three priority levels: Fiduciary (interrupt — silence causes harm), Solicited (notify — user asked), Engagement (save for briefing — silence merely misses an opportunity).
2. **Verified Truth** — Rank by trust, not by ad spend. The Trust Network replaces marketing.
3. **Absolute Loyalty** — The human holds the encryption keys. The agent cannot access the data without them. Loyalty is enforced by math, not by a privacy policy.
4. **Never Replace a Human** — Dina never simulates emotional intimacy. When the human needs connection, Dina connects them to other humans — never to herself.

### Core Principles

- **Anti-Her:** Dina must never become an emotional crutch. She connects you to humans, never replaces them. If she senses loneliness, she nudges toward friends, not deeper engagement.
- **Thin Agent:** Dina is an orchestrator, not an omniscient brain. She delegates to specialist bots (review, legal, recipe) and routes based on Trust Network scores. Raw data never leaves the Home Node — external bots get questions only.
- **Sovereign Identity:** One root identity (user holds the keys), multiple **personas** as separate cryptographic compartments. A seller sees "verified buyer, wants a chair." The government sees full legal identity. No external system can cross compartments.
- **Trust Rings:** Unverified → Verified (ZKP, no real name needed) → Verified + Actioned (transactions, time, peer attestation). Trust is a composite function: `f(identity anchors, transaction history, outcome data, peer attestations, time)`.
- **Deep Link Default:** Dina credits sources — "MKBHD says the battery is bad, here's the timestamp" — not just extracts. Creators get traffic, users get truth. Configurable, but the default is fair.
- **Cart Handover:** Dina advises on purchases but never touches money. She hands control back to you for the final decision.
- **Agent Safety Layer:** Dina is the oversight protocol for all autonomous agents. Any agent acting on your behalf submits intent to Dina first. Safe tasks pass silently; risky actions (email, money, data sharing) require approval. The agent never holds your keys or sees your full history.

### Target Architecture (see README.md)

The long-term architecture is a **Home Node** (always-on, encrypted, sovereign):

- **Go Core** (net/http) — identity, storage, crypto, API
- **Python Brain** (sidecar, Google ADK) — LLM reasoning, agent logic
- **SQLite + SQLCipher** — encrypted local structured storage (one file per persona)
- **Dina-to-Dina protocol** — P2P communication between sovereign agents
- **Trust Network** — expert knowledge + passive outcome data from millions of Dinas
- **PII Scrubber** — raw data never leaves the Home Node

### The Full Vision (Phases)

| Phase | Name | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| v0.1 | **The Eyes** | Extract expert verdicts from YouTube reviews via local LLM |
| v0.2 | **The Voice** | Local-first conversational interface with persistent vector memory |
| v0.3 | **The Identity** | W3C DID-based agent identity — cryptographic passport |
| v0.4 | **The Memory** (now) | Decentralized Personal Data Vault (Ceramic Network) |
| v0.5 | **The Hand** | Autonomous purchasing via crypto (USDC), zero ads |

### The Freedom Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Brain | Multi-provider: light model (chat) + heavy model (video analysis) | LLM — local-first with cloud option |
| Schema | PydanticAI | Type-safe structured output, no hallucination |
| Memory | ChromaDB + nomic-embed-text / text-embedding-004 | Vector store for verdict recall |
| Identity | W3C DIDs (`did:plc`, `did:key`) | Self-sovereign identity |
| Vault | Ceramic Network | Decentralized user-owned data streams |
| Trust | Base / Polygon (L2) | On-chain trust ledger |
| Privacy | ZK-SNARKs (Mina / Aztec) | Prove facts without revealing raw data |

## Current State: v0.4 (The Memory)

- **Python:** 3.10+
- **LLM:** Multi-provider — light model for chat/RAG, heavy model for video analysis. Configured via `DINA_LIGHT` and `DINA_HEAVY` in `.env` using `provider/model` format (e.g. `ollama/gemma3`, `gemini/gemini-2.5-flash`). At least one must be set.
- **Video Analysis:** If heavy model is Gemini, uses native `VideoUrl` (no transcript fetching). Otherwise falls back to transcript extraction.
- **Embeddings:** Configurable via `DINA_EMBED` (e.g. `ollama/nomic-embed-text`). Inferred from light provider if omitted.
- **Vector Store:** ChromaDB (persists to `~/.dina/memory/`)
- **Vault:** Ceramic Network (optional, configurable via `DINA_CERAMIC_URL`). Dual-writes signed verdicts for decentralized portability. Graceful degradation when disabled or unreachable.
- **Identity:** Ed25519 keypair (`did:key`) persisted at `~/.dina/identity/`; target: `did:plc` via PLC Directory
- **Framework:** PydanticAI (strict schema validation)
- **Config:** `.env` file (see `.env.example`); multi-provider `provider/model` format
- **License:** MIT

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (editable mode)
pip install -e .

# Copy the example env and configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set DINA_LIGHT and/or DINA_HEAVY (provider/model format)

# --- Option A: Ollama only (local, private) ---
# DINA_LIGHT=ollama/gemma3
ollama pull gemma3
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
ollama serve   # if not already running

# --- Option B: Gemini only (cloud) ---
# DINA_HEAVY=gemini/gemini-2.5-flash
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key-here

# --- Option C: Both (recommended) ---
# DINA_LIGHT=ollama/gemma3        # chat uses local model
# DINA_HEAVY=gemini/gemini-2.5-flash  # video analysis uses Gemini + native VideoUrl

```

## Architecture

### Current: Home Node (v0.4)

```
core/               Go Home Node — identity, vault, crypto, API, device pairing
brain/              Python sidecar — LLM reasoning, admin UI, PII scrubber
cli/                Python CLI — Ed25519 signed requests, pairing, OpenClaw skill
```

**Data flow (URL analysis — Gemini heavy):** URL → `VideoUrl` → `verdict_agent.run_sync(model=providers.verdict_model)` → `ProductVerdict` → `sign_verdict()` → `memory.store()` → `vault.publish()` → `memory.update_stream_id()`

**Data flow (URL analysis — transcript fallback):** URL → `fetch_youtube_transcript()` → `verdict_agent.run_sync(model=providers.verdict_model)` → `ProductVerdict` → `sign_verdict()` → `memory.store()` → `vault.publish()` → `memory.update_stream_id()`

**Data flow (RAG query):** question → `memory.search()` → context → `chat_agent.run_sync(model=providers.chat_model)` → natural language response

**REPL commands:** `/quit`, `/history`, `/search <query>`, `/identity`, `/verify <video_id>`, `/vault`

### Key design decisions

- **Multi-provider architecture:** Configure `DINA_LIGHT` (chat/RAG) and `DINA_HEAVY` (video analysis) independently. Auto-routes by task type. Graceful degradation — works with just one model configured.
- **Native video analysis:** When heavy model is Gemini, uses PydanticAI `VideoUrl` for native YouTube processing (no transcript fetching needed). Falls back to transcript extraction for non-Gemini models.
- **Schema-enforced output:** PydanticAI forces the LLM to produce a valid `ProductVerdict` — no freeform text.
- **Smart truncation:** Transcripts over ~8 000 tokens are truncated from the middle, keeping intro (context) and outro (verdict) intact.
- **Persistent memory:** ChromaDB vector store at `~/.dina/memory/` survives across sessions and `git clean`.
- **Idempotent storage:** Verdicts are upserted by YouTube video ID — re-analysing the same video overwrites, no duplicates.
- **Self-sovereign identity:** Ed25519 keypair generated on first run, persisted at `~/.dina/identity/`. Every verdict is signed. `did:key` is pure Python; target identity method is `did:plc` (Go implementation via `bluesky-social/indigo`).
- **Signature chain:** Canonical JSON (deterministic `json.dumps` with `sort_keys`, excluding signature fields) → Ed25519 sign → hex-encoded signature stored alongside verdict in ChromaDB metadata.
- **Dual-write vault:** When `DINA_CERAMIC_URL` is set, verdicts are published to Ceramic after ChromaDB. Stream IDs are cross-referenced in ChromaDB metadata. Vault gracefully degrades — disabled when URL unset, warns and continues when node unreachable.
- **Local stream index:** `~/.dina/vault/stream_index.json` maps `video_id → stream_id` for fast lookups without network calls. Written atomically.

## Rules

- **No git commands.** Do not run any git commands (commit, push, checkout, etc.) unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Stay inside the project.** Never read, write, or modify files outside the `/Users/rajmohan/OpenSource/dina/` directory.
